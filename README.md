# Hate Speech Detection in Turkish using BERT-based models 

This seminar delves into the complexities of detecting contextual hate speech within the unique framework of Turkish language and culture, focusing on the essential methodological strategies for accurately annotating tweets with hate speech to enhance the accuracy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. The seminar features a concise, hands-on workshop on employing BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for effective hate speech detection. Participants will engage in an immersive, practical session, gaining firsthand experience in training and predicting with NLP models. This initiative aims to equip attendees with the skills and knowledge required for advancing hate speech detection methodologies in multilingual and multicultural contexts, thereby fostering the development of more ethical and nuanced AI technologies.
